### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult

## Development

```bash
npm install
```

### Using MCP inspector

Load MCP Inspector in your browser:

```bash
npm run test:mcp
```

Open http://localhost:6274/

### Using a real MCP client

To use local stdio MCP server. In your MCP client configuration, use the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cloud-run": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/this/repo/cloud-run-mcp/mcp-server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

To use remote MCP Server in a MCP client:

Start the MCP server locally with:

```bash
npm run start
```

Then, in your MCP client configuration, use the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cloud-run": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "http://localhost:3000/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing

### To test creating a new project (not using MCP)

See the `test/test-create-project.js` script. Run it with:

```bash
npm run test:create-project
```

This script will guide you through creating a new Google Cloud project and attempting to link it to a billing account. You can optionally provide a desired project ID.

### To test a simple deployment (not using MCP)

See the `test/test-deploy.js` script. Run it with:

```bash
npm run test:deploy
```

This script requires an existing Google Cloud Project ID to be provided when prompted or as a command-line argument.

## Publishing to npm

To update the [npm package]https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google-cloud/cloud-run-mcp)

Run the following:

- `npm test`
- `npm version minor`
- `git push --follow-tags`

Then a [GitHub Action]https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-run-mcp/blob/main/.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml) automatically publishes to npm when new releases are pushes.
